# Design Notes
Design consists of ...
+ Layout - including __sizes__
+ Typography - which fonts, where, what size
+ Colours - which ones, where actual val



+ You will need two designs, a main and an alternative

# Updates

<h2> Typography <h2>

+ Added 3 fonts: MerriWeather, Oswald, Work sans (might be changed in the future)
+ Oswal font will be used in interactive elements( buttons,dropdowns)
+ Work sans will be used for text elements ( descriptions, specifications, paragraphs)

<h2> Sizes <h2>

+ Few element sizes been added for the most important website featurs like: nav bar and cartwheel imgae size.
+ These sizes will probably change troughout the development stage. 


<h2>Testing<h2>

For testing I am going to make up a draft website design which doesnt include any styling, assets, but just bland components in the places that wireframe is put in.
<br>
After that, I will document any changes and updates on here...
+ Test 01
<br> I have successfully added fully functional navigation bar that can direct the user, towards "About us" and "Contact us" pages.
<br> Next step is to make other pages functional.
