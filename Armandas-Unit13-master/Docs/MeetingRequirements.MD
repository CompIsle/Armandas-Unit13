<h1>Meeting the needed requirements</h1>
<h2> Owner requirements</h2>
 Owner requirements were met by choosing a good domain name and making sure it represents the company. Let's say like gbphones.uk and the cost would be Â£0 for 1 year.
 <br>
 Also the owner requires that the assets contain their sources to not face any copyright claims in the future, the assests must have their links, prices, and names. This documentation exists in Docs>Assets.MD .
 <br>
 The owner obviously cares about the costumers aswell so he will want the website to be easily navigatable, easy to read and attractive. The attractive part will make users to come back and even get more costumers.
 <h2>Maintainers requirements</h2>
 Maintainer requirements were met by sourcing an asset list which contains informations such as: specifications, prices and source website. Creating the right documentation, good and easily accessable folder structure and a github repo.
 <br>
 <h2>Visitor Requirements</h2>
 Visitor requirements were met by planning out a good layout of the website.
 <br>
 The visitors will need the website to be user-friendly, which means they will want readible fonts, good colours and good navigation.
 <br>
 <h2>Designer requirements</h2>
 Designers requirements were met by creating two different wireframes "A and B" which then was examined further and chosen as a main wireframe. The data gathered from survey said that wireframe B is better than wireframe A, since it is easier to navigate, looks more futuristic and takes up less space. Wireframe A has it's products stacked down the home page, and can be accessed by scrolling down, while wireframe B offers a neat carousel to quickly surf troughout selection, buy/phone page is more appealing to an eye too, while wireframe offers simple text boxes for specs, wireframe B offers more interactivity e.g Drop down description.

 <h2>Styling Intro</h2>
 So now we are at the point where we talk about fonts, sizes, colours and other styling elements.
 <h2>Fonts</h2>
 So the fonts survey has picked for my website are: "MerriWeather" which will only be used for Name of the website which will be on top of the website, then we have "Oswald" which will be used for the nav bar and buttons that contain text within and finally "Work Sans" which will be used for any other text(descriptions, information, etc..)<br>
 I used these fonts, because: They match the theme of technology and are easily readible. 
 <br>
 <h2>Sizes</h2>
 First we have the main component which is the carousel of the home page which will be 60% of the website width and 40 of the view height. Website name which will be on top of the website will include 80% width and 10 view height. Next to the name we will include 2 logos 1 at each end of the site, they will both be 10% width and 10 view height. Navigation bar will extend all the way of the webiste which will be 100% width and will have 10 as view height. 
 <h2>Colours</h2>
 For the colours I have a pallete of colours I am going to use, but I am not sure where or how I will use them.
 These are the colours: FF7300(Safety Orange), 000000(Black), 67697C(Black Coral), D3D4D9(Light Gray), BB0A21(Firebrick).

 We used data to provide these colours. Survey said: "The colours have a good contrast and matches the theme of the website". This data helped us and we were able to source the colours.
