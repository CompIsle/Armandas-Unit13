### Conclusion
Maintainer has met all the criteria needed to complete owners requirements.
## Visitors
### The website can be accessed
Visitors were able to access the website without any issues.
### The website has functional navigation
Visitors were able to navigate troughout the page by using navigation bar or clicking on the images.
### The website is responsive
Visitors were able to navigate troughout the website on different size screens although smaller screens seem to have some issues. For example: Navigation bar ending up behind the page content or content doesn't seem too responsive although it still works.
### The website has content appropriate to the bussiness
Visitors didn't see anything but the phones, which means yes it is appropriate.
### Conclusion
Visitors had barely any issues going to the website and navigating it.
## Changes
### Layout
We had minor changes made with the layout. For example, in the previous prototype the text on the home page was not planned, but we implemented it because the website gives more content and context on what it has.
### Why is it beneficial?
Because the first thing visitors see is the home page, and if we add more content in, the visitors will have more idea about the website, what it offers, how is it any different and so on and so on. 
### Phone Page 
The buy page has been implemented with a carousel, instead of just having a static picture like in a prototype which allows more content to be added in one place.
### Why is it beneficial?
It attracts more attention to the product, because there is a video about the product which may give sense that the phone is popular between people.
### About Us Page
In the prototype this page was not planned, but we introduced it to provide more content.
### Why is it beneficial?
Well people might want to know more about company, which can lead to more loyal costumers that will end up using this company for their tech instead of others.
## Feedback

I have asked my peers for feedback on my website. This is what I received:
|Name|Number|Comment|
|:---|------|-------:|
|Viktor|1|The phone pictures should be better if they were centered bellow the description of the phone so the grey part can be on the whole width of the page. To many colours used on the webpage, it will be nice if they were no more than two. The background colour is so bright. In "about us" page the drop down menu opens up infront of the page causing a some kind of bug.
|Morgan|2|Background is too much, as in my eyes are drawn more towards the background rather than the phones. Phones need to be more centered, not behind an image. The about us page needs to expand through the whole page rather than the squared space.|
### Does it meet the minimal requirements?
Yes it does, the website is functional and it can be navigated trough.
### Are there any constraints that could affect the way website performs?
Yes, there are some bugs and styling issues that could be fixed in a later build. For example:  Drop down menu on mobile view tends to go under content in About us page when extended. Another issues is that the nav bar does not span trough the whole pages and cuts off on the sides.
