* Feedback
* Sources

# Evaluation

## Meeting the requirements
### Owners 

The owner of the company wants the website that represents the company, attract costumers and be worth the cash. Owner has to be sure that all the documentation is there incase of any checks or copyright claims.

#### How the owner helped with meeting minimum requirements
The owner provides us with a rough idea of what he/she wants for the website. Anything ranging from content to the websites naming and branding.

### Maintainers

The maintanance team will need to prepare good documentation, an up-to date aseet list, github repository and make sure everything is working good and is up-to date.
#### What we used
* GitHub repository
* Visual studio code
* Tables that include:
  * Names of the phones
  * Prices of the phones
  * Links to the source image
#### How did the maintanance helped with metting the requirements
Creating a good folder strucutre, helped with making sure that all the work is in the right places like: documents, images, website files.
<br>
Writing documentation, will provide a good proof of work which includes testing, checklists and notes.
<br>
Time doesn't stop so the maintance has to make sure everything stays up-to date. If a project gets updated the documentation has to be updated aswell with all the changes. If a link to source image doesn't work anymore, the image needs to be replaced with another one that has a working source website.
Same with the actual website, it needs to keep up with the times. The maintance will handle it.
### Visitors
Visitors need the website to be easily accessible, easy to navigate. They will want description about the products and some selection of products. 
<br>
These things can be met by designers and developers.
### Designers
We believe the website will meet it's requirements by designing user friendly interfrace which comes in many different form. For example: Fonts, colours, layout.
#### What we used
* Fonts
  * "MerriWeather"
  * "Oswald"
  * "Work sans"
* Colours
  * Safety Orange (Hex: FF7300)
  * Black (Hex: 000000)
  * Black coral (Hex: 67697C)
  * Light Grey (Hex: D3D4D9)
  * Fire Brick (Hex: BB0A21)
#### How the design helped with meeting the requirements
The sites playful yet formal colour pallete, makes the website interesting, but not to the point where it distracts the user from the actual content. It gives life while keeping the professional feel.
<br>
Furthermore the website provides a very simple but efficient navigation, with a click of a button you can access "About Us" page.
<br>
Finally the fonts chosen were easy to read but different from the usual which again gives the website it's unique feel without compromising on proffesionalism.
## Changes
We had minor changes made like some of the layout. For example, in the previous prototype the text on the home page was not planned, but we implemented it because the website gives more content and context on what it has.
<br>
Another change the site went trough was the buy page being implemented with a carousel, it gave the page more interactivity and it was an easy way to add a required video.
### How the changes to the site helped with meeting the requirements
Changing the site a little bit helped to make space for additional content requirements.
