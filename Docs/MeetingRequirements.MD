<h1>Meeting the needed requirements<h1>
<h2> Owner requirements<h2>
 Owner requirements were met by choosing a good domain name and making sure it represents the company. 
 <br>
 <h2>Maintainers requirements<h2>
 Maintainer requirements were met by sourcing an asset list which contains informations such as: specifications, prices and source website. creating the right documentation and creating a repository in github.
 <br>
 <h2>Visitor Requirements<h2>
 Visitor requirements were met by planning out a good layout of the website with visible and easy accessible navigation. I am not sure if the transaction end was a requirement, so I did not reasearch it.
 <br>
 <h2>Designer requirements<h2>
 Designers requirements were met by creating two different wireframes "A and B" which then was examined further and chosen as a main wireframe. I went with wireframe B, since it is easier to navigate, looks more futuristic and takes up less space than wireframe A. Wireframe A has it's products stacked down the home page, and can be accessed by scrolling down, while wireframe B offers a neat carousel to quickly surf troughout selection, buy/phone page is more appealing to an eye too, while wireframe offers simple text boxes for specs, wireframe B offers more interactivity e.g Drop down description.

 <h2>Styling Intro<h2>
 So now we are at the point where we talk about fonts, sizes, colours and other styling elements.
 <h2>Fonts<h2>
 So the fonts I picked for my website are: "MerriWeather" which will only be used for Name of the website which will be on top of the website, then we have "Oswald" which will be used for the nav bar and buttons that contain text within and finally "Work Sans" which will be used for any other text(descriptions, information, etc..)
 <br>
 <h2>Sizes<h2>
 I found this task a little bit more difficult, but I managed to think of few main components sizes. So let's get on with it. First we have the main component which is the carousel of the home page which will be 60% of the website width and 40 of the view height. Website name which will be on top of the website will include 80% width and 10 view height. Next to the name I will include 2 logos 1 at each end of the site, they will both be 10% width and 10 view height. Navigation bar will extend all the way of the webiste which will be 100% width and will have 10 as view height. 
 <h2>Colours<h2>
 For the colours I have a pallete of colours I am going to use, but I am not sure where or how I will use them.
 These are the colours: FF7300(Safety Orange), 000000(Black), 67697C(Black Coral), D3D4D9(Light Gray), BB0A21(Firebrick).
