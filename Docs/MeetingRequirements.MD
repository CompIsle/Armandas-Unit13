<h1>Meeting the needed requirements<h1>
 Owner requirements were met by sourcing an asset list which contains informations such as: specifications, prices and source website. For now I do not meet the requirement of Domain, because I haven't thought of it yet.
 <br>
 Maintainer requirements were met by creating the right documentation and creating a repository in github.
 <br>
 Visitor requirements were met by planning out a good layout of the website with visible and easy accessible navigation. I am not sure if the transaction end was a requirement, so I did not reasearch it.
 <br>
 Designers requirements were met by creating two different wireframes "A and B" which then was examined further and chosen as a main wireframe. I went with wireframe B, since it is easier to navigate, looks more futuristic and takes up less space than wireframe A. Wireframe A has it's products stacked down the home page, and can be accessed by scrolling down, while wireframe B offers a neat carousel to quickly surf troughout selection, buy/phone page is more appealing to an eye too, while wireframe offers simple text boxes for specs, wireframe B offers more interactivity e.g Drop down description. One last thing to mention, I didn't talk about fonts, sizes or colour, because I can't fully know how I am going to put everything together without testing.
