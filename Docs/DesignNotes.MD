+ You will need two designs, a main and an alternative

# Updates

+ Added 3 fonts: MerriWeather, Oswald, Work sans (might be changed in the future)
+ Oswal font will be used in interactive elements( buttons,dropdowns)
+ Work sans will be used for text elements ( descriptions, specifications, paragraphs)

<h2> Sizes <h2>

+ Few element sizes been added for the most important website featurs like: nav bar and cartwheel imgae size.

For testing I am going to make up a draft website design which doesnt include any styling, assets, but just bland components in the places that wireframe is put in.

After that, I will document any changes and updates on here...
